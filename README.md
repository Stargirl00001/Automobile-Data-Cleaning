# ðŸš— Automobile Data Cleaning Project
## Aisha Busari

## Introduction:
This project focuses on cleaning the **Automobile dataset** which was originally messy and contained missing values, inconsistent formats, and placeholder symbols like `?`.  
The dataset was cleaned using both **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** and **Excel (Power Query)**.

## Objective:
- Handle missing values in both numeric and categorical columns  
- Replace placeholder symbols (`?`) with proper `NaN` or meaningful values  
- Convert data types (e.g., strings to floats/integers)  
- Standardize the dataset for further analysis  

## Tools Used:
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Excel**: Power Query  

## Steps Taken:
1. Loaded the raw `.data` file into Python and Excel  
2. Replaced `?` symbols with `NaN`  
3. Filled missing numeric values with **mean/median**  
4. Filled missing categorical values with **mode**  
5. Converted all numeric columns to the correct data type  
6. Saved the cleaned dataset as `.csv` for easy use in analysis  

## Results:
- Cleaned dataset ready for analysis and visualization  
- Improved data consistency and reliability
